# GoTop
A simple animated scroll "Go to Top" javascript with no dependencies within only 557 Bytes to do the trick.

## Demo & How to use

Just add the script before your last `</body>` tag and a link with an ID "gotop" into your page:

    <a href="#top" title=" Go to Top " id="gotop">â†‘ <span>Top</span></a>

That's all!
You can specify an anchor as a target for fallback (if javascript is disabled).
