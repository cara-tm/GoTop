# GoTop
A simple animated scroll "Go to Top" javascript with no dependencies within only 862 Bytes (517 Bytes gziped) to do the trick.

## Demo & How to use

Just add the script before your last `</body>` tag and a link with an ID "gotop" into your page:

    <a href="#top" title=" Go to Top " id="gotop">â†‘ <span>Top</span></a>

That's all!
You can specify an anchor as a target for fallback (if javascript is disabled).

## Settings

The [first strings into the script](https://github.com/cara-tm/GoTop/blob/master/GoTop.min.js#L2) allow you to set some variables which govern the behaviours:

* `distance`: The distance in pixels from the bottom of the HTML document when the go top link appears. Default: `300`
* `link`: The ID name associated to your link. Default: `'gotop'`
* `adjust`: Allows to correct the final position in pixels to the top of the HTML document on the scrolling animation (if needed: due to extra spaces (personal bookmarks, extensions, etc.) into the browsers window). Default: `100`

See [the `demo.html` file for example](https://github.com/cara-tm/GoTop/blob/master/demo.html "Discover").
